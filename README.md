## üß† Overview

**Fluide et Libre** is a minimalist blog application combining front-end interactivity and a dynamic PHP/SQL backend.  
The architecture focuses on modularity and clarity ‚Äî each section of the website is handled through PHP components dynamically loaded in the main `index.php` via a URL parameter switch.
